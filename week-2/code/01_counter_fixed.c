/*
 * 01_counter_fixed.c
 *
 * The race_counter from Week 1, now actually correct.
 *
 * Two threads each increment a SHARED counter ITERS times. The
 * critical section — counter++ — is protected by a pthread mutex,
 * so only one thread can execute it at a time. The bad interleaving
 * that produced the wrong answer last week is now structurally
 * impossible.
 *
 * Compile:
 *   gcc -Wall -pthread 01_counter_fixed.c -o counter_fixed
 *
 * Run many times. Unlike last week, the result is always exactly
 * 2 * ITERS. Try it:
 *   for i in {1..20}; do ./counter_fixed; done
 *
 * Notice also that this is SLOWER than the racy version. Locks have
 * a cost — the threads spend time waiting for each other instead of
 * doing real work. We'll talk about that trade-off in the theory.
