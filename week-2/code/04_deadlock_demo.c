/*
 * 04_deadlock_demo.c
 *
 * A program that deadlocks on purpose, so you can see the symptom
 * and learn to recognize it.
 *
 * Setup: two threads, two locks.
 *   - Thread A locks resource_x, then tries to lock resource_y.
 *   - Thread B locks resource_y, then tries to lock resource_x.
 *
 * If the timing is right (and we make sure it is with the sleep),
 * A holds X and waits for Y, while B holds Y and waits for X.
 * Neither will ever release. The program just hangs.
 *
 * This is one of the four Coffman conditions ("circular wait") in
 * action.
 *
 * Compile:
 *   gcc -Wall -pthread 04_deadlock_demo.c -o deadlock_demo
 *
 * Run — and BE READY TO PRESS CTRL+C, the program never finishes:
 *   ./deadlock_demo
 *
 * Look at the output. Both threads print that they took their first
 * lock, then print that they're waiting on the second — and that's
 * where it stops, forever.
 *
 * THE FIX (don't apply it here, but understand it):
 * Always acquire locks in the same global order. If both threads
 * locked X then Y, there would be no cycle and no deadlock. This is
 * called "lock ordering" and is the most common deadlock-prevention
 * technique in real codebases.
