/*
 * 02_atomic_counter.c
 *
 * Same problem as 01_counter_fixed.c, different solution: C11 atomics.
 *
 * Mutexes are general-purpose: you can protect any block of code with
 * them. But for simple operations like "increment a counter," they
 * are overkill. The CPU has hardware-level support for atomic
 * read-modify-write instructions (compare-and-swap, fetch-and-add,
 * etc.). C11 exposes these via the <stdatomic.h> header.
 *
 * An atomic_long behaves like a regular long for most purposes, but
 * any operation on it is guaranteed to be indivisible. No lock
 * required.
 *
 * Compile:
 *   gcc -Wall -pthread -std=c11 02_atomic_counter.c -o atomic_counter
 *
 * Run and compare timing vs 01_counter_fixed:
 *   time ./counter_fixed
 *   time ./atomic_counter
 *
 * The atomic version is typically 2-5x faster than the mutex version
 * for this simple workload. But atomics only work for very simple
 * operations — anything more complex than a single read/write/RMW
 * still needs a mutex.
